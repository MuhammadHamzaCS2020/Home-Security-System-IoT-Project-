# Home Security System (IoT-Project)
The project describes the smart home security system using the edge concepts of the Internet of Things. In this project, we have used NodeMCU IoT platform. It includes firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 module. The term "NodeMCU" by default refers to the firmware rather than the development kits, NodeMCU to the internet or cloud for data storage (MySQL on my PC and Firebase Cloud Data storage). 
This module sends the data of sensors e.g. Motion, Distance, Humidity and Temperature sensors to check the availability of human being or animals outside the home especially in late nights to handle thieves, dacoits, and suspicious people. And send these sensore values to cloud. (Java Server aand Firebase).

# Application Side

Web App (Show these Sensor data on Web app) and also show the graph of these values. Web app get data from MySQL server.
Mobile App Show these Sensor data on Mobile app and also show the graph of these values. Mobile app get data from Firebase cloud Storage.
